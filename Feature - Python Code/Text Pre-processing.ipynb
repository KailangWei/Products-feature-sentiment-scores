      "i love it i was looking for a small dewalt li charger this one is good for tight spaces or over the wall and its very efficient charging the batteriesthe battery included was a little bit larger than the ones i already have so i had to remove the metal hanger from the drill in order to use the new batte so far no problems preform as expected good deal to save your 18 volt tools worked well and easy works great except with my finish nail gun easy to use and a great way to extend the life of the older generation tools the 20v conversion kit is a great price and value the new smaller battery is lighter and not as bulky as the 18v batteries i am so happy that i changed over the vault see only time i buy the best worth the cost nice to have a conversion from the old batteries and reuse the original tools very pricy they are making a ton of money on these batteries i love my speaker so much awesome bass system its exactly what i want although i have an older corded circular saw when we began our house remodeling i decided that i wanted to get a cordless saw to use for making quick cuts be it boards panels or trim i liked the idea of having the saw available whenever or wherever i needed it without having to worry about stringing out the extension cord especially for a quick cut or two already having several batteries and being a fan of dewalt i took a look at their offerings and purchased the dcs391b 20v max 6-12quot; saw i have been using the saw now for 6 months and i have been extremely pleased with its performance the saw is lightweight which i have found makes it much easier to control especially for long cuts on plywood panels although the saw is quiet it has plenty of power to handle whatever cuts ive needed from trim pieces to framing lumber and even trimming off the bottoms of wood doors with ease the shape of the grip handle with its rubber covering is comfortable while the power trigger safety and trigger switch are both easy to operate the depth of blade and bevel adjustment knobs work well and the blade can be beveled up to 50 degrees the lower blade guard moves smoothly and retracts by itself as you make a cut but also has a lever to retract it manually when necessary changing the blade is easy and the saw comes with an allen wrench for removing the retention screw the allen wrench fits nicely in a recessed hole in the handle so that its always with the saw the dcs391b is a dependable saw and a great value i always wanted a good cordless set of tools im after having 2 corded circular saws and a couple corded recip saws my best friend moved away and gave me his pair of 20v drills and this little skil saw with 2 ah batteries and charger i thoughtif there ever was a time to start the cordless tool set i always wanted the time was now like a lot of peoplei can get into a different type of job to do everyday had someone call about spreading a bit of crushed stone he had asked if i would dig a couole holes for a cement pad with the freedom of cordless tools i was able to pick up the extra bit of money on the job because the house was brand new with no power yet i was able to bring the saw build the couple boxes and i was hooked i now own 8 20v tools and 6 batteries and a couole chargers and couldnt be happier not the most powerful saw but then again it is battery powered worked decent enough for quick cuts especially in the parking lot cutting wood to fit in your vehicle dewalt to me is the best tool on the market great saw easy to use great great tools incredible power that lasts way longer than anything iu2019ve used before not even a year and my hammer drill doesnu2019t work anymore the part where you adjust is stuck and cannot be losen the best for the money on the market excellent product this is the best drill kit by dewalt the drills work great and with the flex volt it puts milwaukee to shame over the last 2 years we have burned up 2 milwaukee hammer drills and not 1 dewalt bought it spur of the moment when i saw it on sale dewalt is one of those brands i will buy simply because of the name as their gear has not failed me in the past very solid the driver is small so it will fit in tight places battery life is really good the only issue was the bag as it is totally useless for my needs the dewalt combo drill set i purchased has been very good to me it has surpassed the expectations i had for these drills the only regret i have is that i did not purchase any drill bits but thats my fault wow light powerful and with the right battery will be a workhorse for you i have mostly brushless tools but do not care that this is brushed i have dewaltamp; ridgid mostly and a 6 12 in craftsman v20 saw and i will tell you this is one of my favorite tools quality built in usa is a bonus do yourself a favor and dont overlook this saw working very goodthe only problem i have is the battery isnt to strong to the saw very good typical dewalt quality if itu2019s like my other dewalt tools which i suspect it will give years of service so far iu2019m happy with this saw great power works great holds charge very useful to have a spare battery for using while charging another i liked this package so much im going to purchase the dewalt weed wacker tool works great cost less then a replacement battery great tools excellant value work great really got this for the saw but bonus extra drill never hurts saw and drill were awesome this last week when building a potting shed for the wife terrible sound very easy to pair in any devicegood quality sound and long reach bluetooth capabilitystrongly recommended to any contractorthe only downside is that is not waterproof but you can have all for that price its great for bluetooth music and loud enough even weld welding and other loud jobs a great set at a great price  i like that performance great quot;end capquot; deal works with all my cordless the adapter works as intended but the only thing is not to leave the batteries in the tool when not i use as it will drain the battery great battery life and power perfect forhome projects nice saw  great price for quality saw better tork than the portercable one i have of the same size i bought it specifically because of the left handed cut i like to see the line im cutting too bad they charge so much for batteries you need two to get any work done i havent used much yet so i cant say how it performs the real test is ripping plywood or partical board which wears down a battery fast i really wanted the bigger 7 14quot; saw but it is a righthanded cut which i consider a flaw in the engineering design this saw is great for the small stuff but wont work well on 4x4 or 4x6 cross cuts it is hard to find proper blades for the 65quot; in the store i prefer diablo thin kerf home depot had the xr model on display i bought this one because i wanted the smaller 65quot; version but the build quality and controls are not nearly as nice as the larger saw for only a few dollars more if i were to go back id skip this one and get the larger xr the saw worked exactly how it should thank you plastic is ok but not a plastic shoe though although it works well cuts nice with enough power to get the job done light weight powerful and battery lasts a long time awesome saw  love this saw very simple to put on blade only issue is battery has short life span definitely get a second one if you can i like the saw - i was looking to buy the battery pack with the converter also so i could keep using my 18 volt toolsthe good news is it runs great and solid - i was stuck buying other batteries - i get an add that says buy the batteries and converter and get the saw - this was what i wanted but i guess now i am stuck paying more money out to get batteriesi have bought 3 more tools in the past few months always wanted this saw to finish out my collection of dewalt cordless tools had used this saw many times in the past now i have my own just so great to have around when you need to make that one or a couple quick cuts without having to break out the corded saw or on the jobsite really sucks up the battries but works good i was a little bit skeptical at first but when i started using it i was pleasantly surprised it is a great saw cuts through wood like butter i also bought a different blade with more teeth i am happy i chose this one easy to work with not to heavy but powerful the battery lasts enough fir most projects very good so far had originally purchased milwaukee fuelyes they have a lot of power but chronic trigger sticking on drill resulted in returning both always had dewalt nicad dropped them stepped on themused them to build several garages decks etccame back to lithion platform no issues great tools at a great price i ripped a 2x4 and cross cut it with the saw it worked great same for the screw guns this is an excellent package i was lucky enough to get this combo on sale each product is responding as expected and the bag is a plus i havenu2019t had the chance to use the tools yet but iu2019m confident they will perform as promised im impressed by the performance of dewalt i love italso excellent battery performance was exactly as it says meet my expectations enjoy the new flexvolt battery great deal drill comfortable to hold easy battery installation as shown excellent quality slim batteries great torque and a steal of a deal with sale cost of 159 i have only used it once but i love it dewalt always great value and very happy with these great product all the power i needed for some wood working projects drill seemed to be refurbished my husband loves it works great love dewalt just fine quality is good came with circular saw first use of fully charged 15a batteries with the drill quickly died i need to run a test to see if either battery is bad for what i was doing i expected much better life out of the batteries easy to use and the batteries last a long time i love it great deal also got a bluetooth speaker with it made it totally worth it great back up battery i love it great addition sounds great like the usb port to charge my phone one criticism it does not charge a battery got it free with purchase of battery and charger and sounds great  easy to use and setup great sound perfect for work i just baugth the dewalt tool pack less than 2 years ago and both my batteries quit working i rarely use the system but when i needed it it failed had no choice but to come buy a new battery system it charges fast and last longer than the one that came with my drill plus the fact that i can check the progress of the charge is great works great perfect size battery for almost any job excelente i like that you can use core or battery good product and brand but the battery doesnt last too long great sound and size this speaker is impressivei was not expecting it to be so loudwould recommend to anyone speaker ready to go out of the box easy to pair very good sound quality i saw this product as a tie in with dewalt batteries this bluetooth speaker is a decent low-cost unit although it lacks a bit on the low-end sound i bought it for the shopjob site overall im pleased with my purchase not really good i bought and air pump but it didnu2019t come with the charger it came with the battery but no charger i had to spend an extra hundred dollars in order to make it work it was kind of pricey it is greatworks perfect nice for my dewalt collection the charger works great i needed another battery nice little battery first we thought it was radio or a cd player but no for something that supposed to be a job site speaker there is no volumeim going to return it works as advertised it was a black friday special deal that came with a job site weather proof bluetooth speaker and all three are great i needed another battery charger and the 30ah battery is a good size throw in a bluetooth speaker and all at a special sale price you can not go wrong great sound runs for days on a old 20ah battery nice sound and looks cool great sound i ignored the reviews and bought this anyway as stated in other reviews the adapter is now stuck in my jigsaw its not coming out without breaking it if you only want this for one tool then no big deal i wanted it for more than one tool so it is a big deal it works fine its just not coming out also as stated in other reviews do not leave the battery in the adapter after use as it will drain the battery i love dewalt tools but this adapter sucks a little pricey but is a great item after charging battery it doesnt seem to last long enough over a period of timemaybe a hour or so depending on usage quot;light medium heavyquot; works like a charm lighter and fast charging great happy i bought on line itu2019s a great way to convert your older tools to a more modern and powerful battery itu2019s only downfall is that itu2019s sometimes difficult to release from the tool when you want to plug it into another very lightweight extremely thin blade plenty of power easy to handle guide and keep straight the battery life could be a little better but the bonus pack with 2 batteries makes this easy to deal with the best thing about this is making a cut across a 4 board and not having a cord to foul up a straight cut got it on sale for a great price too works well with all my other dewalt 18 volt tools does add a small bit of length but can live with that lt works but batteries made for the product at a reasonable price would have been better works better than the original batteries i have used this tool a lot over the last year since i bought it i am very happy with the tool the only thing that i would have to make known is that when using this tool make sure that you are using a stronger longer lasting battery if you dont then it binds up with simple cuts great battery good quality tool lightweight for quick cuts on small jobs good quality product long battery life no wobble that i can notice i just need more projects now to use it more  got this battery to power a 7 14 saw and it holds up well with that tool runs the smaller tools all daygood product and good price it a nice tool ive only used dewalt for the last 15 years or more with cordless tools the tools are better to best but its more about the batteries like printers are about the ink if you follow what i mean so concerning performance dont know how they stack-up they are expensive compared to other leading brands works great better than the last one love this combo lots of power new 60v battery is great excellant drillhammer drill will drill thru a concrete wall on the 60ah battery and uses no juice at all this battety will literally last you all day under heavy use the impact however w the 15ah will only last 14 of a average work day under heavy useon low tordue high pressure it also tends to jump off of your fastner and could cause injury like mine did to me orherwise as long as it stays on the screw it will sink it with easethe charger has a builtin fan and charges the average dewalt battery in 30min or less great power at a great price this kit has the force and the battery life to push you through a full day of work the 887 impact drove over 500 2quot;-3quot; wood screws before depleting a 2 amp battery the 996 hammer drill is versatile and powerful as well on the flexvolt battery it drilled a few dozen holes in wood drove many screws tightened a few bolts and sunk 16 holes for large concrete anchors the bits were boiling off water in the rain but this thing kept going battery was still showing a 23 charge by the end of the job drill machine is great and with 2 battery for extra charging perfect i upgraded my 18-volt dewalt to the 20-volt drilldriver and impact combo kit and it was the best purchase u ever made dewalt tools are the best on the market by far one of the best products that i have ever bought very good price thank you very much for the help that i received really good excellent quality; great brand for a small drillimpact set they produce more power than i expected the sleep work really great great tool worth the value battery and dewalt are verygood really like dewalt products that batteries included donu2019t last very long but the saw worked goog love this tool quick and easy to use works awesome for all our house updates this is a great portable circular saw light and with all the necessary angle adjustments works great great deal bought it as a gift for my son looks good and will serve hes projects quite well it wasnu2019t what i expected sorry ive been a die hard ryobi user for years this is not my first dewalt set i had one years ago i got as a gift i always figured the ryobi was great for the price and i was right but for the few extra bucks the dewalt is the way to go the performance and the feel is well worth the extra great set and a great price excellent product overall lots of power highly recommended love it should have bought one of these a long time ago cut through wood and nails like it was butter easy to use and i especially like the battery operated tool no cords to mess with dewalt has never let me down great sound and it takes the 60v flexvolt batteries the speaker works great battery last for a long time i wouldnu2019t have bought it if not for the deal works with all my other 20 volt tools a little bit of extended life over the 2 amp hour well made very happy decent for 79 but the sound is a little muffled--like its a little heavy on the bass it needs a control to turn up the treble is anyone noticing this maybe i got a bad one eh you cant charge batteries with it and i thought you could its really no better than the smaller speaker for a cheaper price i think im going to return it easy and great for small tight corners dewalt is a proven name i bought this along with a dewalt impact driver after searching for a week home depot was the best ace to buy this thanks home depot nice good battery what a great deal on a great tool fantastic product wish i had bought months ago cant say enough makes old tools lighter and stronger with the voltage works great interfaces with my old tools and should last longer and deliver more power was able to keep my old set of tools and not have to buy new ones what a great idea for those of us that still have a chest full of older 18v works good extends the life of good tools works exactly as it should long battery life must longer then old style the power and longevity of the 20v in the 18v tools is awesome only downside thus far is the difficulty to swap the batteries in and out of the adapter and in and out of the tools the plastic clips are not as responsive as one would like hopefully over time the break in and swaps are easier this will allow me to keep some of my older dewalt 18v tools functioning my older 18v batteries had given up keeping a charge and this was less expensive then replacing 6 individual tools great way to use older tools with new technology this product does not fil my dewalt drill excellent product my tools work better more power i have a small shop in my garage and i couldnt be happier with a 4 amp hour battery i can work on a project and never have to worry about losing power saw cuts well and nimble too i love this tool almost as much as the dewalt jig saw i bought the circular saw worked well for finishing cuts i swapped the blade out for 24-96 teeth and it worked even better the 18v adapter worked as advertised the fit was very snug and the lithium ion battery needed to be removed before said adapter the deal was great for what was given a good buy it was a gift the person was very happy with it great value works great with grinder good very good product and value for the moneyeb i love it the 3 ah battery and charger were free with the purchase of an advertised dewalt power tool free is great but if i had to purchase this alone it is way overpriced i like my collection of dewalt xr tools and i guess iu2019ll continue to pay the price to play with them excellent product i still own a bauer 20v drill system and dewalt definitely outperforms it hands down never again will i buy cheaper version of product worth the money just in batteries alone too this is a very good combo kit the impact drill is awesome i really like dewalt tools all worked out ok just as i expected except for one of the batteries at least to be defective it will not take a charge and if it does it diesrather quickly great deal on an awesome battery quick charge and long lasting works great for all my tools and the blowerneed 2 to run weedwacker for entire yardrecomend getting the 20vmax60v flex bettery for that very good holds a charge and keeps me working thats all i can ask for it to do excelent great product this drills are worth the purchase iu2019ve had this exact same set for over a year i used them like crazy beat them up work like they were still new i would recommend this set to everyone battery charger isnu2019t working lightweight enough to not wear the operator out during a full dayu2019s work initial battery charge lasted only lessthan two hours the second full 24 hourcharge lasted all day excellent drill i really enjoy using it i love my new drills i canu2019t stop using them i always look for something to do i love the drills fast charging battery great combo kit drill and impact drills i like the lights and the drills are powerful but the batteries run down fast light compact and reasonably powerful but it is no match against my corded dewalt circular saw excellent tools excellent honestly ridgid is better value with lifetime warranty and free batteries i also just found out- dewalt is owned by black and decker i would never use a black and decker tool in my life and be seen with it but now i know dewalt is the same thing lol just overpriced yellow black and decker tools all the tools i wanted great buy and itu2019s dewalt great set for the price connects immediately to phone easy to carry volume on speaker controls volume on phone a lot of bass  missing some mids and highs  very sturdy doesnu2019t charge batteries but will charge phone this little thing is nice sound is fantastic i use it all the time now when i work in the garage it gets plenty loud and i like the fact that i can either use one of my batteries or plug it into the wall looks to be built rugged as i would expect from dewalt would definitely buy again great power pack for my new dewalt milti-tool perfect for remote site ranch work; where electricity is not availablecuts as well and smoothly as any handoperated electrical saw battery works like a battery should charges up well or as expected the oscillating tool came with it and works well i have used a couple of times and works well but with other reviews thought it would blow me away which it did not does the job its intended for well the only thing i donu2019t like is that it canu2019t be plugged in at the same time a battery is in it so you canu2019t charge a battery with it great charger i was so excited to try out this new speaker however the aux cord did not fit tightly so the speaker only worked when i was holding it i had to use my dewalt battery to listen i will be calling dewalt we purchased this with the sawzaw it works great more powerful at 20 volts than the electric dewalt we had dewalt makes great products love it poor sound quality worked as advertised another great product from dewalt well when i was searching for an affordable quot;dewalt radioquot; this unit popped up when it arrived and i used it for the first time i was disappointed that it was just a bluetooth speaker and not at all a radio galse advertising amp; a mediocre product light powerful charges pretty quick saw cuts ok but the 3 amp battery doesnt last long charges my battery i have had good luck with batteries awesome lots of power and long lasting dewalt is one of the best brands out there today this battery holds the charge strong for at least 4 hours the dewalt ion adapter pack is great it holds the charge very well since the other batteries are phasing out this is a great option for anyone that has dewalt products this product gave new life too obsolete tools havent plugged it in yet but the shipping was lightning fast thanks batteries and adapter work quite well a little odd looking but everything is in order good value works great with no problems purchased this to replace my old worn out 18 volt batteries havent had a chance to use this very much but for what i have done it seems to work very well great option to upgrade from nicad to li-ion without having to buy new tools would be five star if batteries didnu2019t have a minor draw when left connected and top portion of adapter matched size of the base on 18v tools for a cleaner aesthetic i have only used it once but it worked great i do wish it had a rip fence as always dewalt hasnt disappointed me i love battery powered options and this new saw is awesome i am new to home ownership and thus far both tools work as they should batteries last a long time these drills are very good i love them really suprised how well this is built of course ive only used it for a few cuts so far but it has plenty of power for a cordless saw this drill was easy to setup light weight no electrical cord to worry about either it easily sawed thru everything that i wanted without issues uses the same batteries as my other tools so i always have one charged up ready to use amazing this was a gift for my dad he is so satisfied exactly what he wanted my son in law assembled the unit  it worked just great all tools work well great drill and impact driver combo kit i had bought the brushed motor version of these by mistake initially and was glad i took them back for the brushless ones these are much more quiet and dont have a funky smell when they run good drills they cover a wide variety of functions i wish the batteries were a little more powerful but over all they have been a worthwhile purchase definitely a good deal nice drill and impact meets my needs for good price the tools are great strong and durable but i need bigger batteries the cordless drill did not work had to bring it back lightweight affordable with enough power for any of the needs of the homeowner love dewalt my old dewalt 12u201d drill had pushed through a lot of projects and performed well beyond expectations for its size and served me well looking forward to projects ahead especially now having a second drillimpact driver to handle those jobs that i used to put my regular drill through ok after my 18v drill took a dump  gears striped out and nobody in this area to fix it  i had to replace it i was looking to use this for taking off my commercial mower blades with a few people telling to go bigger  i decided to give this a try i had used the adapter to go half inch with a larger socket and wow this little gun does pack the power again iu2019m using it at my shop not doing any commercial customer repairs it is more than what i need very good product great drill great price works well nice capacity battery not too heavy great condition amp; i love the 4ah battery awesome battery  super deal with sustained power at a very affordable price so far so good great battery it is my go to battery for my circular saw best long runtime quick recharge the battery life is amazing and fast charging great battery it came free with my cordless circular saw which is really great excellent good size and power and easy to handle lightweight and powerful tool purchased because i already have dewalt tools - quality stuff - and the batteries that work with them cut line on the left for us right-handers makes it easy to see the blade and where its going it worked beyond my expectations does a great job i got it at a great price get one you donu2019t know what your missing great saw durable and reliable easy to use and works very well good torque fast cutting great tool as a casual users it works as good as any other circular saw ive used now im looking for additional blades i would buy 2 batteries then we could have completed our job in one day we ran out of power and had to wait for it to charge but it was being used to cut our sheet rock in a bathroom remodel easy to use quick charging amp; long lasting i have a number of 20 volt max tools now and i am very happy with their performance the battery and charger came free with a purchase of a 20 v sander the saw was delivered on schedule and is of very good quality have used it a couple of times to prune trees and it worked great i love dewalt love dewalt tools only complaint is now i need to buy new drills because the batteries are different great charger ive had this one just a month now and love it never had any trouble with it or past models either that ive owned all my power tools are dewalt this has a nice new sleek design works perfectly like all my dewalt tools charges too slow better off with the 115 battery doesnt fit good in any tool the 3amp is different than the other batteries nice tool and plenty of power  this dewalt cordless reciprocating saw does everything well that i need it forthe 30 ah lithium-ion battery seems to hold its charge indefinitely even after 3 hoursof outdoor use a far cry from the old nickel-cadmium batteries being able to change saw blades without a wrench is a bonus very good tool delivered as stated quality product at a really good value long lasting batteryused on 4 wheel rotation and all around brake pads replacement for gmc sierrastill had fulll charge lights showing on battery this speaker is awesome it has great volume and itu2019s light weight i take it every where with me great buy having a hard time with it only wanting to connect to one phone love it nice little blue tooth speaker a yes this tool is awesome the unit is overall very nice the sound is quite good and battery life is awesome no worries on batteries since i have 20 to use along with 7 chargers the slim line batteries work nice to reduce weight and size the phone holder and charging port are great the only reason i did not rate five stars is the annoying volume control there are preset steps in the volume and the mid level volume ends up either too quiet or too loud the volume control should be linear with infinite adjustments not good enough for that price loud and portable powerful and easy to handle dewalt the tools you must have love dewalt products and i couldnt pass up this deal so thrilled to get battery operated circular saw and two powerful drills for a great price all three tools put out plenty of power for diyu2019er all is working well am satisfied yey i bought this at a special price for the combo you cant beat dewalt tools for their value their premium price is quite worth while the package would have been a little better at the price if a larger battery were included for the circular saw but overall i feel it was quite worth the special price for the package purchased this set as a fathers day gift to my husband and he loved it good quality tools and excellent bags to store them i think this set is a great starting set for a beginner craftpersonhandyperson could use a another battery with this set other than that everything else was just fine i havent used the sawsall yet but very impressed with the other tools especially the impact good tools good price impact and drill are weak no speed controls the tools arrived ahead of the time that i was told and were just as i expected i have dewalt tools and find that they are excellent equipment that is the reason i bought this set great love it the product itself is perfect bought for my husband for fatheru2019s day he loved it so much only compliant was shipping which was disappointing home depot was more than willing to try to remedy my situation but it didnu2019t fix the fact it arrived about a week later than initially stated it was beyond my expectations did the job i would recommend it great price the dewalt circular saw rips through wood like butter even when the battery isnt fully charged the saw spins up and stays strong throughout the cut ive used this to crosscut 2x8s rip plywood and never had it catch mid-cut also great that the 3ah battery works with my dewalt drills so i always have a spare the adapter once inserted into a tool is nearly impossible to remove it comes with 2 batteries it may as well come with none as that is how long the use is on the pack it takes twice as long to charge as it does to run out so you have to plan your job with this in mind - you will need things to do as the other pack is charging and the one currently in use is dead yes i could buy another battery but how about save us some money and forget the useless batteries lesson learned i am leaving dewalt after years of using their tools nice handy tool i like it great addition to save my ni-cad tools exelent product fast delivery came exactly as described worked with all my 18v tools very cost effective quick charging easy to use great kit to have ready to use on any 18 volt dewalt tool give wonderful power to any tool and nice to have one available when all power is deleted charging station makes it nice to have one on the charging station and one on the tool you are using excellent product good tool to have easy to use and works good good price - i like to wait for a sale on needed items but not immediately needed items including the adapter is a bonus adaptor doesnt click in very easily and is difficult to remove i tried in multiple dewalt 18v tools i own sad im used to better quality from dewalt when first seeing it  it was not the idea i had but after using this is is outstanding thank you dewalt for having some of the greatest products on earth the adapter was tight but will be ok i tried it out and it worked great a very good buy adapter is functional but a but awkward have only used with driver as unable to use with drill yeta bit dissapointed with ease of removal of batteries from both charger and adapter and underwhelmed with time btween charges per charger display and charge life very handy for small projects around the house i paired with a 4ah battery and it lasted for the whole day [this review was collected as part of a promotion] great light duty saw i mostly use it to breakdown 12u201d and 34u201d sheets plywood for cabinets it has ruined corded saws for me now [this review was collected as part of a promotion] i bought this a year ago and have been very happy with the usefulness of this saw i wish i went with the 75u201d saw but the 65u201d has worked well [this review was collected as part of a promotion] i use and abuse the dewalt skill saw not like it was intended for but it keeps on going [this review was collected as part of a promotion] i bought this saw to replace my dads old saw from the 70s what a difference great productgreat deal with the two extra toolsbought two batteryu2019s for the other tools and all is good great product dewalt man for life excellent tool dewalt quality as always top notch productand service drill hand grip plastic was warped and wasnu2019t connected together leaving sharp edges in the hand grip returned it this product was awesome you must have these drills its a game changer the flex-volt battery has a tremndeous about of power the drills and drivers are top of the line when it comes to speed and power the charger can charge a battery in a few minutes great combination note the lights that are on the tools are super bright blue type lights dewalt battery mounting system is looserattles in the all tools inadequate designsurprising because cheeper consumer version bamp;d system is nice and tight the only thing this is missing is a box instead of a bag to store it in the tools work great but the flexvolt battery will not hold a charge great light weight drill with tons of power great tool the driver seems pretty basic but the drill is legit - super powerful i purchased this to use on a nilsusa ice auger the combination eats ice plenty of power and the flexvolt battery came home still holding a full charge flexibllty of the drill work and play on the work side this thing will also drive half inch lag screws into 100-year-old hardwood barn boards have only used charger once but it seems to charge well it is easy to read and understand hope batteries last a good long time this was included with a 7 14 saw they were a great deal on a special buy day i charged the battery and it powered up the saw for the project i was working on i expect to get a lot of use out of this set one bad thing not a deal breaker circular saw isnt brushless or xr meaning extended runtime awesome power tools ; lots of power and quick charging great cordfree freedom and a great packaged deal works great and plenty of power with the 4ah battery i wish i could have had the option of the 60 volt circular saw this one is gold but not as powerful as i need the better tools right now loved it best investment i have ever made the tools are high quality and they were delivered in a timely manner so far so good working as expected very well satisfied with price and shipping thanks these work very well the impact kicks in and makes the work easy exactly what i expected from dewalt fast shipping and good price i have several de walt battery powered toolsthe 20 volt is the lightest with plenty of power and battery life as usual great tools from dewalt my only complaint i wish the impact tool had torque settings like the drill driver great deal purchased on sale - as a gift great 20v max pro quality starter set very easy to use and load blades it is a great collection of tools batteries and charger are great but the adapter did not fit into my drill and was very disappointed i have only used these batteries on one job i am impressed with the rapid charge time and the battery life i like the indicator light that tells me how much battery is left i have several of the old style 18 volt drill motors and impacts so these batteries will get a workout nice way to transition from 18v to 20v the product help me to not have to buy a new drill nice extra power longer lasting lighter weight throwing away a perfectly good drill amp; charger even a set of tools because the new style batteries donu2019t fit the your current equipment is ridiculous this setup allows you to up grade to better batteries and still keep your working tools works great was a christmas present for my husband and he was very happy the driver was one of the best tools ive ever used my first project was to fasten an oak face board to an oak fence board to a locust post with a 3 12 deck screw easy its so light an maneuverable i find myself using it for everything around the farm great tool my husband absolutely loves the whole kit it was a great deal on great equipment i have knocked out several projects since i bought it great set and great value brushless makes the jump to 20v really worth it everything came quick and functions perfectly just need a few more batteries to last out the day best drills i ever owned though and powerful impact drill has ability to change speeds 123 1 for screws  2 for medium duty drilling and 3 is what i like to call violent mode  long story short my drill is stuck on 3 no matter what i number i move the button to  also when it comes to drilling the trigger button gets stuck  great products very fast shipping great toolbut the drill and driver have too much wobble when drilling and driving its sturdy and excellent tool for my project at home using it to renovate my garage cabinet instead buying those commercial cabinet and keep me busy so far right nothing broke down easy to set up and use it as long you take care it recommend it to others everything works great great tool set amazing battery life so far great drill charges quickly and provides ample power when asked for will order an additional for backup for large jobs cuts and grinds like a corded grinder nicely designed light weight and easy to use im a safety kind of guy so i really like the blade protector and the hand fit i got it for christmas and its been put to use since then battery charges quick and last pretty long glad i made this choice after receiving other brands not to say there not good but this was the one for me awesome tool first of all i am a former professional wood worker and carpenter who owns a dewalt 12quot; compound sliding bevel miter saw and a dewalt contractor portable table saw but i decided on picking up some side jobs again so ive been tooling up my inventory i have a classic corded 7 inch wormdrive skillsaw that is my heavy duty work horse and goes through pressure treated lumber like butter but i needed a smaller lighter cordless saw for cutting hard to reach areas elevated positions and some on the fly cutting where digging out the wormdrive beast is just too much being a user of dewalt tools for years and having several drills on the 20 volt system i decided on going with the dcs391b model in the past i had used my father in laws old 18volt cordless dewalt saw and it performed well enough although battery life was poor which i chalked up to an old 18volt battery which has shortened after years of use i can attest that the lithium 20 volt battery system on my drills are awesome as they last through long hours of abuse and use and in addition after seeing so many good reviews on this saw i expected more than decent performance i even got a great deal on two new 5 ah lithium batteries dedicated just for this saw but i was very disappointed after only 10 minutes with my new saw as i began ripping through about 3 feet of 34quot; birch plywood the saw initially responded very well smooth and sharp on the cut then after a few seconds or about the 4 foot marker the blade binded and stopped working i flexed out the board to relieve the cut line and still no dice changed out 3 different fully charged batteries and the blade couldnt even perform a small crosscut on soft 2x4 pine i dont know if my experience is unique or what but theres no way that is normal for even the cheapest poor quality circular saw a single rip cut through 4 feet of 34 plywood shouldnt throw the saw that out of whack going to return it and get my money back id like to think that maybe i purchased a defective saw and give it another try but the experience has left me with doubt makita and milwaukee are a bit pricier but their tools consistently put out performance that seem to never fail great little circular saw that worked allot better than i expected this saw although small has a tremendous amount of torc and will buzz through small jobs in a hurry i was skeptical at first my choice was between this and the milwaukee after using this to build a room in my basement this performed better than i expected run time was much more than anticipated on a 2 ah battery i got through cutting all of the studs for a 10 x 14 room and didnt have to switch to another battery i was impressed works as advertised use it often to shred 2x4s will building an outside shed everything was great but one if you going sell with bonus kit you should have a bigger bag for it or a second bag should be included this is one great combo set every piece is versatile yet specific great power for many diy projects excellent professional tools at a really great price iu2019ve worn 2 previous 14v drillhammers out previously these 20v max should last for a long time grate package-excellent price they last longer are just as easy to put on aok the drill was lightweight and quiet ordered on one day had it at the door the next what a shock item is the bomb charges in short time has all kind of power thank you drill set is very good powerful and easy to use the 13ah battery in 20 volt will let me handle 80 of the stuff i do because of its light weight its the one i usually pick up good machine nice product works like a charm the flex battery is amazing very impressed with the performance and new features still running the 18 volt tools but now these are my first choice to use battery life is great excellent quality great value ordered this as a xmas present fur my husband heu2019s more than thrilled he will only use dewalt tools great stuff quality appears that it would last a long time with proper care and use its a good starter set to keep in my truck i plan to add more to the bag which has plenty of room for additional tools great tools excellent value purchased this tool set for my husband for christmas and he is in love with it all he was like a little kid opening it up for christmas and he would recommend it to everyone especially working in hvac i am extremely happy with my purchase because it makes him happy and makes his job a little easier with the tool set all products were great great power with great run times run time with some tools on the 20 ah batteries isnu2019t the best but home depot also has great prices on extra batteries i love this 9 piece tool combo  i havenu2019t been able to use them yet but i tested them all and seem to work just fine just like the other dewalt tools i own and the price special was just right got it as a christmas present from my wife i like it does the job for me great set however i would have liked to have another battery rather than the radio quick charge and much more power batteries last a lot longer the adapter works but provided much less power than expected attached to my dewalt saw it cant be used for more than a few cuts before it stalls you could use it for an occasional cut or crafts you could never use it to do substantial carpentry work worked intermittently in 18 volt angled finish nailer the old 18 volt batteries worked fine they just dont hold the charge as long as they used to i returned one kit and purchased another with the same results i have several other 20 volt dewalt tools i was hoping this would have worked as this is the only 18 volt tool i have left works perfectly fine but i wish the adapter would fit the entire drill base to make it a little more attractive on it works good itu2019s a little hard to remove the adapter stem from the tool so you can move to a different tool iu2019m hoping this gets better with wear bought this to replace my 18volt batteriescharger works welli found the reviews saying adapter was hard to get onoff unsubstantiatedi would have preferred a 3 amp battery with this set but i will buy a largerone down the road charged quickly and seems to be providing amplepower to my 18 volt tools  hammer drill dw988circ saw rep sawglad to be leaving the ni-cads behind great adapter packageeasy to charge easy to put together easy to use with older 18v tools works great this si a good way to upgrade if you have a lot of different tools tool will outlast the battery great the saw was a snap to assemble battery charged fast and last a long time i recommend this product it is great and smooth longer battery life is always a plus very good set no issues the deal i got on these was great the tools themselves are some of the best there is batteries last a long time it was great and showed up on time i love it canu2019t find a better drill set nice unit with the power to last a long tome i use it for a variety of applications from hammer-drilling concrete to driving screws it has been a reliable set and well worth it the 60 v lithium ion batteries are great these drills really care of business excellent hammer drill and impact driver free sander and oscillating tool canu2019t beat this deal  very happy with my purchase flex volt batteries are sweeeeet did not come with belt clip screw had to purchase separately i only recently purchased the drill and havent had a chance to use it much but my first impressions are very positive it has great features and seems like it is solidly built and has a high quality chuck i bought the combo because the drill was one of their upscale models and because they added a circular saw and vacuum for quot;freequot; as expected drill has worked great for the day to day use i put it through as an electrician the hammer drill and impact driver are incredible tools the dcd996hammer drill is rated funnytypical way sbd does it at 820 unit watts out once converted its 840 inch pounds i swear its more than that ive ran 3 inch 38s lag bolts in to a new fence i was building and it ran them with ease its a power house no matter the drill bit auger or spade bit this thing will power through whatever you throw at it with the three speed gear box ratcheting chuck and 3 brightness settings this drill is by far one of the best out if you dont like the bag tools come in you can buy nice strong tool case and tool box craftsman series versastack at reasonable price for example drill case under 20 both drills are very well constructed batteries provide enough juice for and task i looked at a lot of brand named cordless drills and multi tools makita milwaukee bosch hilti ridgid and robi and i came across dewalt which had a rating of 47 this combo kit had the best value more for your dollar so i purchased this product online and i received it in a timely manner and also came with a carrying case i am very happy with it the value i saved was outstanding the 20-volt max lithium-ion cordless brushless combo kit 2-tool w flexvolt amp; 20v batteries bonus batteries amp; multi-tool would have cost me 68900 and i purchased it for only 37900 saved nearly 50 highly recommend this item this is a wonderful product and works as good as expected exceeding expectations awesome hammer drill have one at work too great for the price works very well this is the first drill set ive ever bought and it certainly met my expectations very useful tools very happy with my purchase of the drillimpact driver combo set have yet to put them thru any hard labor but worked well installing a couple shelfs good price everything works great and has plenty of power had a different brand several years ago and was disappointed this saw exceeded my expections my son had recommended this and i am well pleased with saw and my new impact driver and drill which are brushless recently helped build a deck worked about five hours driving screws and still had 2 bars i have been a long time dewalt cordless user and have always been impressed and pleased with their tools this saw is no exception no it doesnt have the power of my larger professional versions but for smaller jobs it is great used it cutting 2 x 4 and 2 x 6 boards to build a dog pen shed also cut 4 3inch posts by going around the whole post cuts great and battery held up for the whole project great for homeowner for sure and i am sure it would work for a contractor as well this saw is reasonably light weight and runs very smoothly it is easy to handle and sturdy bought it after borrowing one and using it for a day the light weight blade placement and lack of cord helped me make more accurate cuts more easily than ever before i just couldnu2019t bring myself to ever try to make a straight cut in plywood with my old saw after trying the dewalt great little tool cuts through a 2 x 4 with ease great saw very convenient while out in the field works great except for battery longevity is about 10 minutes depending on what material im cutting speaker works great i use it all day every day at work and has done very well with no complaints this bluetooth speaker is loud very nice and i love it very satisfied sounds not loud enough the order came in really quick and they work perfect sounds great plenty loud and very portable easy to use would buy again bought it for my husband and he loves it its a good little bluetooth speaker compact enough to throw in my tool bag and is pretty load very good sound good items love this tool set all i really needed was the circular saw but the drills were a real plus also the price was perfect awesome deal the batteries are small capacity but work fine for what i need to do had one previously but it was lost liked it enough to replace it with the same product highly recommend this combo met my expectations 100 yes this kit is more than enough for your typical diy-handy-husband ive tackled multiple small-to-medium projects around the house and this platform does not disappoint great tool  replaced my old 144 v dewalt saw  should have bought it sooner not enough power adapter clip very firm battery is great it took a long time for the batteries to take their first charge about 24 hours each it seems before they each had 3 bars indicating full charge i made sure they had good contact with the charger they definitely are lighter than the old xrp 18 volt batteries not exactly sure how long they will work though i guess time will tell delivered on time and in perfect condition i bought it because all my dewalt battery tools are 18-volt and i needed new batteries these work great and i really like the battery level indicators on the packs i would highly recommend this product the saw is very handy and has enough power to cut through 2x4 lumber this adapter kit has brought new life to my older 18v tools on speacial it was cheaper than new ni-cad packs iu2019ll pick up another set for additional batteries and a second adapter to just leave in my tools they can be a bit tricky to remove good deal to keep the old 18 volt dewalt tools working and wont be wasting the batteries when time to upgrade to new dewalt 20volt tools batteries hold a charge well and are powerful havent had to use the adapter yet they seem like they want to make it difficult to buy just the adapter alone i just got this saw and it works great the only the is it didnt come with a bag [this review was collected as part of a promotion] got this for christmas it has all the power to rip a 8 foot 4x4 with out any stalls [this review was collected as part of a promotion] i love everything black and yellow but i especially love this saw it is great having it be blade left thinking about upgrading to the flex volt rear handled saw [this review was collected as part of a promotion] works great the battery is durable and works fine the charger works fine but itu2019s slow compared to chargers from other companies ryobi makita which is frustrating dewalt is a high-end tool brand so why are they shipping these low-end chargers good product i like it very much battery life was about 45 minutes as stated i used it to cut down two semi dead bushes each about 5 feet tall plus smaller shrubs and worked like a charm all in one charge was a quick recharge my only knock is the charger doesnt turn green to let you know its done but thats just nitpicking and changing the blade is a breeze i would buy it again i definitely recommend it battery doesnt last long itu2019s ok as battery charge gou2019s out quick battery came with a reciprocating saw great deal the battery does not fit my drill driver or impact driver without removing the belt hanging clip today is the first day ive had a chance to use it since making the purchase  battery was fully charged amp; didnt last 25 minutes cutting pallets apart  the battery died and is supposed to be 3 amp hour battery  i put another battery on but saw had overheated i guess will probably be returning charges quickly works on all of my dewalt tools awesome product it works fine for bit but needs to be bigger works great sometimes difficult to remove from tool the latches stick and not easy to take off battery battery packs are great just wish that the adapter was more friendly when switching to another tool seems like you need an adapter for each tool that you have worked great on my existing full set of dewalt tools battery life seems good and as powerful as my ni-cads i now plan to get many years of life from my older tools it is nice to have an option to convert over to 20-volt without having to replace a suite of tools the battery life indicator on the front of each battery is a great feature i am displeased with how difficult it is to remove the adapter from each tool i swap batteries around frequently and this adapter does not dislodge from the housing easily i have to release one side at a time and have always had to use 2 hands to depress each black tab but it is a small price to pay so i dont have to replace a bunch of tools all at once and as i expand my inventory it will be handy to have additional 20v batteries 37 out of 5 extended the life of my old xrp tools and is setting me up to be able to start buying the newer tools that use the same batterytools seem to have more power and last longer this product is a win win this really works well used the new lithium battery and adapter in my reciprocating saw the saw lasts so much longer with the lithium battery compared to the original 18v xrp definitely recommend it i like this saw because it is light weight and easy to handle its well built and so convenient being cordless i have never used a battery saw before i could not believe how light weight it is how easy it was control it i cut everything i could throw at straight angle and bevel cuts only had the set for a couple of weeks and the drill is already broken need to send bacj easy to use plenty of power for sawing wood that i use for wood crafting uses the same batteries as my other power tools light weight and cut-line on the left makes it easier to follow your line without being unwieldy would be nice to have higher amp batteries but would also make the saw heavier for the price batteries charger and adapter this was a saw ive been following and waiting for a good price - 129 is about the cost of just the batteries alone what i would like to see in an included saw guide - in searching for a saw guide for this saw has revealed some direct-fit problems even listing a black amp; decker saw guide as the one to buy battery size and saw glide are the only factors in knocking this saw down a star great bargain and great tool i love the 2-volt max tools the battery lasts a long time amp; produces plenty of power this was exactly what i wanted needed and expected quick charge and more than enough power for anything i throw at it this is the second dewalt combo i have bought the first one is the 12v version which is 8 yrs old and still does the job and i use at it home now these drills are the best and work under various conditions no complaints on this set excellent saw manager was great in fixing issue with saw and the new one is awesome the best excelent tools they have power the charger its amazing fast charger was a bonus drill and impact performed well was a father day gilf my son was happy to have thank you husband loves it and how easy and smooth it works great product i enjoy it very muchthank you home depot good working drill excellent value for the money bought this to get sawzall as an extra havenu2019t figured out what a 14 impact is good for yet newer dewalt tools are lighter and cheaper than old better 18volt models i guess thatu2019s what b and d does to you when they own you ive had this set for close to 4 hard years and they are still kicking due to their cheap price i wasnt expecting much out of them and regarding the impact i would often see how much it can actually handle the impact is perfect for basic drywall and wood screws and starts to loose its oomph with lags and separating rusty bolts ive been able to take off some fairly rusted hardware and even lug nuts with the impact the drill is definitely cheap compared to the impact when drilling larger holes around 316quot; and up the chuck likes to chatter itself loose for some reason after a drilling a few holes in steel ill frequently have to tighten the chuck or else the bits just fall out this is a great drill for tapping holes though ive used it to tap 4-40s up to 12-13 the clutch settings and speeds come in handy for this section overall i recommend this kit for a basic around the house tool person but for everyday heavy use id look into the brushless options this was not the drill i thought i ordered i wanted the brushless but itu2019s fine and works for what i need it for the impact is also not brushless but thatu2019s my fault good tools none the less great drills great purchase i got what i paid for and got it quickly first tool i grab plenty of power and long-lasting battery works exactly the way i would expect a dewalt to work great price - does the job around the house i love my drill for the type of work i do around the house so far it has met all expectations great product except one of the two batteries only lasts for 10 minutes i have been dewalt user for over 20 years im sure they will send me a replacement good tools arrived on time good morning quality i purchased the battery part of a kit which included dewalts brushless multi-tool both work great lasts a long time plenty of power for most diy projects im not very happy with this it doesnt hold the charge under load may have to return it well balanced and comfortable to use great tool took a few minutes running the driver for the motor to feel like it broke in running solid now and the battery upgrade was a sweet bonus okl everything i expected works great cool this was a excellent purchase given the bundle price was at a steep discount love the charge level indicator the oscillating tool works great works so good that i bought a second one for myself great deal bought charger and battery set and got 2 spare batteries free im a big dewalt fan and this charger and battery combo affirms my good feeling about their products top notch in all regards just bought battery and charger use them all the time at work awesome with the gun the impact works great but the battery does not last as long as i expected very easy to use exceptionally costly - more than the cost of the tool - unless you are using a number of dewalt rechargeable battery-operated tools non-xr batteries are wider than xrs - work with same tools just require more width storecarrying them canu2019t compare charge life to xrs i dont have an 3ah xr all 15 amp; 5s the non-xr charger has about half charge speed as the xr equiv it was basically free; otherwise iu2019d buy xr batteries the battery is compact allows easy use in tight places great bargain good tool for the job i did bought a tool and got battery and charger free work great works really well lotsa power and lasts a long time great performance good deal with a quot;free batteryquot; however another high end performance brand have a way better deal for a similar equipment you should consider to launch better deals with more equipment so the contractor keep consistency in batteries and chargers great saw cuts everything i want it is a great product i love it does what i need when i need it this is really good dewalt batteries are lasting longer than the junk i had before awesome drill is a beast drill is a very powerful drill and gets the job done in half the time of the original 20v hammer drill his entire xr line is a great investment dry happy with my purchase nice saw it was what i was looking forit was the perfect gift for my husband just what he wanted happy with the drill disappointed with the driver itu2019s unfortunate that it only accepts 14 tools would have thought it would be comparable with the drill in being able to accept different size bits sure made the daddy happy for fatheru2019s day so lightweight and easy to usebattery lasts a lot longer than my 18 voltmakes any job easier to do that is one powerful little impact driver i gave this a good rating instead of excellent because i really did not need the cordless drill just the impact driver but the price on the combo vs the impact drive by itself made it seem silly not to get both great pair of drill and driver only complaint is the bag is a little small for everything very easy to use my husband love it thanks my son loved it  great light weight product drill is not that strong and batteries die so fast just what i needed to finish several home projects  excellent tool power weight and performance great set for the price iu2019ve never had an impact driver before and that has really added to my productivity nice having two batteries with decent life for projects great product and exactly what i had expected with dewalt thanks outstanding performance by both hammer drill and impact holds a great charge with enough power to make the job easier and more efficient the bonus occillator tool is in itself a game changer for me and will be for you if you have not used one before now kit is priced right too works well as expected itu2019s amazing tools this kit is frickin amazing i love how i can do soo many things without having to plug and un-plug tools all the time def a great product and the hd price was amazing tools work great but i was very dissapointed that the circular saw did not come with therip fence and the screw that holds it  not nice i went to use the circular saw and couldnt because the rip fence did not come with it every other circular saw that i have bought over the many years always came with it i then had to call dewaltblack and decker and after a long wait on the phone had to buy it i specifically asked them for an invoice so i can get my money back from the company and when they sent it they sent it with only the shipping document then twice i had to call then and after long waits on the phone until they finally sent me an invoice so i can submitt it for refund with my may petty cash not nice nice little bluetooth speaker works just fine quality bluetooth player works great too bad itu2019s not a battery charger also but sound is descent and i can charge my phone great way to always have a battery waiting its not that loud if i was on a construction site i might not be able to hear anything over my drill great battery life easy to charge very good stereo system i have no problems sinking to it and the sound is great i used it in a shop and for the size it sounds great very good sound for little device sturdy decent sound not audiophile quality but perfect for outdoor bbq or etc good sound compared to my toughsystem radio recently used the 3ah battery for 10 hours at 50 volume after 10hrs the battery is still showing full excellent battery life for about 14 the weight for my toughsystem radio this bt speaker may see more use excellent product highly recommend dewalt to anyone looking for quality and long lasting tools bought for my son  he loves it i am typically a dewalt fan but this radio was poor quality for sound and volume i am not a big music fan so the bar was low to start and it was disappointing took it back good light very bright itu2019s a nice little addition to the crew good deal always looking for others great sound perfect extra battery for my needs great charger and nice size battery i also got the free bluetooth speaker at the same time great sound and nice to be able to use 110 or the 20v battery rugged and has good battery life very nice that it can operate on ac power or battery has great volume and clarity for a small battery powered speaker too you wouldnt expect a speaker like this from a tool company good sound and value only had it for a week the product charges fast which makes it convenient the adapter works but doesnt fit easily into my older 18 volt equipment it is difficult to get the adapter to fit securely and extremely difficult to remove it once it is secured it is handy to be able to use the 20 volt batteries the 3ah batteries last longer and they are a lot lighter this kit rescued all my dewalt 18 v tools the original ni-cad batteries had all died the new batteries are much better and the adapter hardly adds any extra bulk at all awesome tools catfish so far so good iu2019m really pleased with the long battery life and the free radio was a huge bonus very disappointed that i had to buy a battery and charger separately and it did not come with a tool to removeinstall the saw blade the picture showed that the combo came with 2 40ah batteries and it only came with one the description didnu2019t specify just one battery so i was upset that you guys misrepresented what i was actually buying i am very disappointed that you guys are taking advantage of picture vs description ran out of juice pretty quick the first time i used it you cant just go all day long with no charging the battery the worst experience ever dewalt is always doing better tools than others companies the drill was put to a test by me it has done the task well i would recommend it to all works great not impressed with it tools are really expensive to but for it also the batteries included are sufficient but you can tell the difference in the higher ah battery the 3 ah two-pack is 99 working fine so far though i love this collection the battery works great plenty of power to get job done i have a spare ready to go if needed i have the chainsaw circular saw and leaf blower they all do a great job gonna get the weed whacker next ive only used this tool for small quick jobs so i cannot speak to the battery life but when i have used it its worked perfectly and not having a cord is extremely convenient i find myself using it for jobs i normally wouldnt because its so easy to use just pop in the battery and youre ready to go great buy and so convenient to not get caught up on a cord the battery provides steady stable power so your quality of cut doesnu2019t drop the 2amp battery works well with this but i recommend 4amp or above for hours of use this comes with a standard blade so pick up a nice 24 tooth or above finishing blade for cleaner cuts the blade removal key tool stores on the handle bought this saw to replace anther one accurate cutting and easy to use ive only used it a couple of times but each time it meet all expectations great saw cuts good and straight only wish it came with a battery and charger but they get you that way and keep the cost down i owned a newer dewalt drill that did come with those item 2 batteries so it wasnt a big deal just limits you to other brands if you want interchangable batteries it was great i love it drill is awesome great sounds bought the battery and charger for a new bush trimmer for the yard the battery is working great as expected easy to assemble and long power duration great for older battery operated tools as expected  good value adapter part is difficult to grip and remove from tools for charging im not happy with this this kit was not cheep the battery paks did not last as long as my other 20 volt drill the attachment went in for the 20 to 18 volt easily the price was excellent batteries work great i bought a second set of these batteries i absolutely love these as i can still use my 18 volt tools i have a lot of 18 volt tools so this was important to me and the price of the 18 volt batteries make it better to get 20 volt batteriesif only you had a trade in program that would be another better as a long time professional user of dewalt power tools the difference in longevity and ease of use is significant when upgrading to the 20v lithium system the superior battery attachment charge characteristics and added power really make a difference a worthy upgrade perfect fitworks asexpectex it works amazing saw works like a charm easy cutting good power and instant stop on blade would buy again since i have a 18 volt drill and impact driver the battery adapter will come in handy great and so much easier to use i like that the battery charges pretty fast but it doesnt hold a charge for very long good battery fully charged would not last 3 or 4 minutes totally disappointed i have the drill impact and saws all all great products the only reason i purchased the battery and charget was my saws all did not come with a battery and i wanted 3 batteries now i can use my older tools with the new advanced battery the battery piece that allows us to use the old style batteries doesnu2019t allow our finish nail gun to work continuously we have to take it off and put it back on several times when using itnot sure what the issue is battery and charger are great the adapter i found hard to remove from the tool maybe because it was new but it was stiff and awkward to get out the batteries however slide in and out of the adapter easily great purchase and an easy way to get you old dewalt tools into the lithium world so far great producthank you works good difficult to get the adapter to release from some of my tools but i had the same issue with a few of my old 18v batteries too so it could be the tools themselves causing the issue otherwise it works great and is a better solution than buying new 18v batteries for my old 18v tools they die fairly quickly compared to the 18v its very loud it lasts all day and its very clear works good for little projects very handy for small diy jobs its a dewalt enough said great product this is the first set of power tools i own and so far iu2019m loving it works great i bought a blade but it comes with one cuts 2x4 with drill battery i have i will be buying the large capacity battery for it awesome saw a little trouble placing the blade instructions not specific on blade rotation but i figured it out like the saw everything was just as described gave as a gift - he was thrilled seems like the 20 ah batteries did not last long after the first full charge hopefully the length of run time will improve after several chargerecharge cycles because it dewalt this drill is good for my work great tools impressed would recommend great sawneeded 1 quickwould of been better if it came with a battery so handy yet surprisingly powerful the circular saw is phenomenal and i love the blue tooth speaker great saw already have several batteries so it was good to go had to do my own cutting at a recycle home improvement store worked great the saw has more power than you would think very nice too large and bulky not happy with it can they both be returned without packaging difficulty inserting and removing from sanding needed a battery and charger for my new saw great idea and good value easy to do i bought this pack a few years ago and it works great on my older model dewalt drill price is reasonable considering the inflated price charged for the 20v batteries independently as most have stated the adapter is hard to remove from the tool the reason i am not rating higher is the advertisement said it would adapt to the dewalt lights it may adapt to the flex neck light version but comes no where close to the stationary light tower stem is totally different plug configuration one of the batteries didnu2019t make the first day that i bought with the charger iu2019m going to have to return it great battery for my exciting tools the battery is no strong to continue to work got to have it unless you want to by all new tools due to the change in batteries get it while you can wow what a buy this was  home depot daily sale price below cost of hammerdrill alone long lasting battery hammerdrill is awesome and i didnt think a cordless circular saw could be this nice great value for this kitready to go to works as designed also bought adapter to use battery with my older dewalt drill all works well this is my second set steve like these battery pack is working like it should shamefully bad iu2019m considering switching brands over this piece of trash the charger works fine the adapter is kind of hard to get in and out the tool but not total junk the real problem here is the batteries from day one they never really lasted very long and never charged all the way up to three bars they rapidly deteriorated from there by about a year later i was able to drive one or two screws per battery or make about one cut with a circular saw if i was lucky luckily for me i actually had a few 18v batteries that were still waaaaay better than these at about 10 years old now those are finally about done for too so the question is do i buy more dewalt stuff or buy a new set of 20v tools that isnu2019t made by black and decker company maybe buy the other tools since dewalt no longer cares if it sells junk i still go into my local hardware stores and see this shamefully bad product on the shelves and think of all the customers who being rolled it makes me angry the ease of use and the mobility of the saw is a reward in itself very easy to operate great cuts great little saw i like that it is the 6-12 in saw so its a bit more compact than my other circular saw packs a punch the tools in this package are a great price just what i needed to replace the old one a basic saw no extrasitt came with a 3 ah battery for 99 only reason i bought it  have not used it yet great saw battery is interchangeable with my dewalt drills which is very nicethe best things is no more extension cords to drag around when you working away from your shop great saw used it for several projects now cuts through 2 by materials with ease grip is comfortable and blade alignment good seems to have enough power and duration from a charge all in all a good addition to the20 volt system great saw love that itu2019s cordless perfect for small quick tasks as a homeowner great quality of product makes wood workingcutting fun and easy i love the drill and the saw have used the impact driver yet i had to read the instructions book to see that the batteries plugged in with a click in the charger over all am happy with my purchase best drill set to date powerful and long lasting batteries powerful perfect tool have only had a chance to use them both once the batteries charged up quickly and the tools weer powerful enought to get the job done powerful and reliable another great product done the job because of the batteries 13ah have several dewalt tools and have nothing but good things to say about them superior quality good product easy to use very nice dewalt makes a great product see if it last great deal on the price battery longevity did not meet my standards i will be returning these drills great product sold by the best team thank you after a major bathroom remodel i saw the tools my contractor used for multiple tasks after using the drill and impact driver for parts of the remodel i did myself i was sold on this package so looked it up and purchased from home depot lightweight powerful well balanced built in led lights nice case holds both tools charger bit sets i bought and a few more items the battery life of the product is lack luster i understand why there are two batteries because they dont last long at all lightweight with plenty of power love my new tools so far those used have been very efficient and simple good handling saw works good for me the saw itu2019s easy to used whit out cord and light to carrying works for me with a couple 4 ah batteries a very powerful combo kit and vacuum the batteries are on point and are just what i needed for the type of work that i doi love it a very good tool for the money excellent tool set replacing my old one love the brushless feature and dewalt has always made a solid reliable product the drills and reciprocating saw are mainstay tool base very pleased i also purchased the oscillating tool love it and wouldnu2019t be without it iu2019ve used dewaltu2019s for years upgraded from ryobi 18volt to the dewalt 20volt huge difference in power plus the dewalt batteries last so much longer iu2019m extremely happy with the performance weight and battery life of my new dewalt tools i use them daily and couldnu2019t be happy with my purchase works perfect this charger charges very fast and seems to hold the charge longer great value works ok but not as good as corded saw battery doesnu2019t last very long battery i used is about 6 months old - since doesnu2019t come with battery good when need portable option compact easy to use comes with wood blade feels comfortable iu2019m returning this product could not cut through a 2x4 i bought this for my husband for christmas he absolutely loves it it has good power is not too heavy and the 30 amp battery packs i bought to go with this are relatively light and hold a charge well the saw and driver drill are fantastic tools that i could recommend to any home handyman or professional carpenter excellent ergonomics and powerfully that make them a pleasure to use i believe is the best brand out there in cordless power tools lightweight battery lifetime and i wouldnu2019t trade them for any other brand good deal great set of tools with lots of power good buy itu2019s new so it works fine or would have returned it excelent buy great bargain great tool tons of power why are you looking at any other tool it was a gift and he loved it the battery has not held its charge we called dewalt and they were helpful but the battery still does not hold a charge beyond 15 minutes even without continuous usevery disappointing as this was my sons christmas gift and he was really looking forward to using it to complete a few projects over his christmas break christmas gift for son in law and he loves it price was great and got here before christmas very pleased great drill and driver combo own one bought this for a christmas present great set and the circular saw is made for right handed people unlike similar saws my only have my set for a month so far he already used them multiple time very convenient to use because they are wireless and powerful he may buy other tools from dewalt my husband loved his x-mas present totally worth the money great except battery does not fit in my other 20v tools charger works but itu2019s slow rate of charging worth the money battery does not charge after 4 months of very light usage great idea now i dont have to worry about having tomake sure i have 18 volt batteries charged up for all the 18volt tools i own was a little hard to get the adapter off ya just to remove battery first then itu2019s not to bad best thing they ever made i really like it not as much run time as a extended battery pack but cost effective good replacement for the old 18v model dewalt tools are great this purchase was a christmas present for our daughter this combo kicks butt i was only going to get the impact driver but the quot;on salequot; price over the holidays was too hard to pass up i used the heck out of it this weekend didnt need a charge until late sunday on the impact driver very happy with it this combo is all and more than i expected love it lots of power powerful drill set one word describes satisfied noticeable difference between my old 18 volt to the new brushless 20volt good tools easy to use i purchased it for one of my carpenters so far so good just got it 2 weeks into using it great so far these are not what i expected these are not contractor grade and wonu2019t stand up to daily use very good quality its a dewalt cant go wrong great combo works awesome excellent product it has power ease of use practical tough etc both sons love it i am an electrician and exclusively use dewalt power tools i use this saw constantly for ripping down 2x lumber and plywood cuts fast allows for beveled cuts and even though the blade that came with it was a fast wood cutting blade you can still get relatively smooth cuts even on plywood if you dont push the saw too fast its a bare tool meaning no battery or charger also the brake is amazing; let off the trigger and the blade comes to a fast stop instead of continuing to spin like the older models it needs a bigger battery if you want to use it for any period of time but it runs and cuts great great deal great batteries great package with charger and a bag very nice great deal powerful batteries tool bag a plus once again desalt lives up to its name and reputation performance has been fine so far based on limited use to date i bought this for my husband and he loves it driver very light weight and powerful drill has plenty of power  not sure 20 v batteries as good as the old 18v but just means you need to change batteries more this was a gift for my husband and he loved it itu2019s reslly easy to use and very light to carry working great so far awesome tools the impact gun is very handy so is this saw wish i had the tools like this for years man these tools smack i wasnu2019t sure about purchasing because iu2019m indecisive but i am so glad i did the tool is great and so sad i can say is better than any dewalt iu2019ve owned in the past in the end iu2019m glad i choose this one overall great performance and you wonu2019t go wrong buying this cant go wrong with this set great product this is a great drill and very lightweight worked out really good we had it sent to the home depot near our son in law because it was a christmas present for him charged battery put it on drill drill has button to push to see if battery is low and it shows battery is low and battery has 2017 on it and i just got this 11719 havenu2019t called them yet to find out if they send me new battery but they wanted review here it is all the tools work well little disappointed there was no blade included for the recip saw but there was for the circular batteries and chargers are good like the battery level indicators on backs of the batteries everything fits well in the bag too i had a set until november of 2018 but lost them in a house fire i used them all the time now got new set but havent needed them until they get new house built purchased bigger set will more tools to use could have gone with less  sets but didnt want to do it excellent attachments were great and charging time was fast excellent bargin  499 excellent tools great price arrived on time 3 weeks in and everything is working great works great as do all dewalt tools light so i also use it sorry husband would not work in my dewalt bandsaw brought new life to my 15 year old 4 pack works great and very lightweight works great ez wish i didnu2019t need to use this but no choice definitely lighter than before easy to use and the adapter works great saves money when buying this option i was expecting 2 batteries with the instrument but recieved only one  good saw and has lots of power nice balance on it as well awesome tool set from dewalt worth every penny great great combo really happy with this purchase really good tools plenty of power light is plenty bright i do masonry work so abused my set the first weekend i had it performed great great drill lots of power and battery last a long time this will not disappoint charger will charge up batterys up in no time at all the brushless motors run a long time even with heavy usage description of tools was poor returned combo because the skill saw was not what i expected the drill works fine but impact driver runs down very quickly with extended use wish i would have bought brushless muy bueno bought this set as a birthday gift for our youngest son and we love it have used both around the house for putting up new blinds and new rods for curtains has good power and battery life i use the battery in drill driver and framing nail gun works great last all day excellent quality durability and power these tools are not my 1st dewalt tools and certainly will not be my last not because they break they never do but often they do not come home with me great set for a home remodeler or diyer i haved purchased and used many dewalt products in the past 25 years this set is lite weight and with led lighting as well made in the usa keep up the great work dewalt great combo set for homeowner especially with getting a circular saw in the kit thrown in i have done many projects with this set so far and plan on many more i have been using dewalt cordless tools from the beginning my first one was actually a bamp;d 144v cyclone 38quot; drill with xr series batteries purchased in the mid 90s soon after that dewalt took over the industrial line of black and decker and the quality seems to have kept up with technology and this last tool set is no exception other than a cordless drilldriver this is the best most useful battery-operated tool ii have ever purchased goes and goes and goes on a single charge 5ah bat could not be happier unless the saw operated itself this is what i needed to finish my collection this is the second one ive purchased  i live bi-coastal and have one at each house  there is nothing it wont cut through  i love the entire dewalt series and the fact you can purchase the bare tools and if not i would have 20 batteries and chargers  its a great buy i havent cut much with this yet but the things i have cut this does a great job the part i like the most is not having to drag out an extension cord with it or to cord getting stuck in the middle of a cut the weight is great too much lighter than the standard worm drive corded saws i have the same saw in my shop and i love it  i bought this along with the drill and impact driver combo  that way he got the charger and two batteries as well just what i had hoped for lightweight and precise very satisfied works well for quick jobs around the house got this free with new drill it works great fast delivery very nice tool item came as described i had a lesser manufacturer and voltage circular saw that was useless and killed battery quickly  this cuts as good as my old corded saw and battery lasts  i gave it a 4 simply because of the price yes i know you pay for what you get this is a good little saw pretty powerful for running on batteries id recommend having a 2nd or 3rd battery love dewalt  this circular saw is powerful and battery life gets small jobs complete great saw for the job when no electricity is on the job site be sure to get at least a 50ah battery for it and itll do everything you need it to no i wouldnt recommend for framing out a house it wasnt designed for that  but its perfect for ripping plywood and doing cross cuts  i suggest making yourself a saw track as well and this tool will quickly prove its worth this isnt my favorite cordless saw i recommend buying a track guide and measuring the distance from the foots edge to the blade to properly set up your cuts i had an issue with the guide mark on this saw it was hard to keep the mark centered on my line as i cut the build quality is solid but i would not recommend this saw due to the frustration of the guide mark overall i liked it however; the plastic guard isnt quite as heavy duty as i would like if i planned on using it more i would spend the extra money and get the next option up couldnt use this for over a year would have been nice to know that it didnt come with a battery but  came with a blade that wasnt to come with it poor advertising for this product its light weight  good quality but charge wont last long  takes a long time to charge batteries good for smaller projects great saw with good power almost completely stopped using my corded one battery life isnt terrible but highly recommend a spare great product easy to use too week make no mistake this does not perform like a corded circular saw  not only is it under powered but its running a smaller blade and it eats batteries very quickly  with that being said  it is appropriately sized for what it can do you obviously wouldnt want this much power behind a larger blade you wouldnt cut anything  also to add to that there are different amp hour batteries available for the 20v format so yourself the favor of you plan to use this for much and get a higher level batteryi have tried several battery saws however and this is by far the best functional one ive had  its very comfortable in the hands and really helps you get to those awkward spots with its smaller size  i have built decks and framed rooms using no saw but this one it can get the job done  it just depends on your battery ratings and your ability to keep them charged  this thing can take a beating too ive had this a long time and its been dropped wet and faced the hot cold without affecting it  i only buy dewalt anymore i recommend this product overall this is a great saw  the biggest advantages are the portablility and reduced weight  this saw is ideal for small projects encountered by both contractors and diyers  the fact that you dont have to account for an extension cord is a plus  for those who are accustomed to worm drive circular saws with the blade left orientation you will certainly enjoy this as this saw has a blade left orientationthe battery life is adequate but not great  this is something to account for when planning a project  the lowest capacity battery i would use would be the 4 ah dcb204  if you have access to the 5 ah dcb205 battery or any of the flexvolt batteries that would be preferred  the power rating associated with this saw is good  make sure you buy the model marked with the type 3 motor  there is an older version with a type 1 motor that is underpowered and i would not recommend that one  something to be aware of is the blade guard black in color is made of plastic and not magnesium or stamped aluminum  im not sure how durable this portion will be over the long haul or if droppedthe only project i couldnt envision using this saw for would be production framing large tract housing projects  there is a larger flexvolt 60v worm drive type saw dcs577 for this type of work or a good old fanshioned 15 amp corded circular saw for those types of projects  otherwise you wont regret owning this saw and i highly recommend it big pos save your money and get a corded still this thing will make 2-3 cuts then needs a recharge i have dewalt everything and fortunately have many 20v batteries the circular saw is a price of junk bought this for a christmas gift and my guy was over the top excited to get it uses it all the time and saves time  husband adores it excellent gift for him and me i like that this saw is lightweight and easy to use high quality and i like that the brake stops instantly when the trigger is released has depth adjustability with measurement gauge and 45 degree angle it is easy to use and great for cutting sub-floor stringers 2x4s and much more i have had no issues with not being able to keep up with the tasks ive subjected it tothe reason i bought this one is because almost all of the dewalt power tool package kits i was looking at buying all had \"left-handed\" circular saws i didnt want and dewalt flashlights i didnt need so i didnt buy the kit i bought the \"right-hand\" saw i wanted and bought the other power tools i wanted that were in the kit individually also the kits only came with two 20ah batteries that i didnt feel would keep up with heavy use of a saw like this so i bought the dewalt 60v reciprocating saw kit that had two 60ah batteries that would be better suited for this circular saw it was only slightly more expensive to get the tools i wanted individually but got what i wanted and the batteries i preferredthis saw was purchased tool only the battery in the picture was purchased separatelyreally like this saw and would buy it again\n"
